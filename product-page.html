        <h2>Surely, you've heard these myths surrounding cat training...</h2>
        <h3>Myth #1: Cats Only Respond to Punishment</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Fact:</b> Not only is this extremely false, it's extremely harmful.
          This can cause anxiety in your cat, make unwanted behaviors worse, and
          affect your relationship with your cat.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is always best to use positive reinforcement to train your cat,
          just as it is with a dog. The cat with associate the desired behavior
          with the reward and be more willing to repeat the behavior.
        </p>
        <h3>Myth #2: You Can Only Train Younger Cats or Kittens</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Fact:</b> Cats of all ages can be trained. While it may take longer
          with senior cats, it is quite possible to teach them new behaviors.
          The saying "You can't teach an old dog (or cat) new tricks" definitely
          doesn't apply here.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Myth #3 (perhaps the biggest myth of all): Cats are impossible to
          train.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Due to their independence, most people assume that it's pointless to
          train a cat. However, it's been proven time and time again that a cat
          can be trained to not only stay off the counter and keep their claws
          off your furniture, but also perform tricks such as "sit," "stay,"
          "fetch," and "high-five"--just like dogs.
